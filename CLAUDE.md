# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
`claude-config` is a Go-based unified configuration management tool for Claude Code. It provides configuration management, proxy setup, hooks system validation, DeepSeek API integration, NTFY notifications, and resource installation through a manager-based architecture.

## Development Commands

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build the application
go build ./cmd/claude-config
# Or using make
make build

# Install to ~/go/bin
make install

# Run all tests
go test ./...
# Or using make
make test

# Run tests for specific packages
go test ./internal/config
go test ./internal/proxy
go test ./internal/file

# Run tests only for git-changed files (useful during development)
make test-changed

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Code Quality and Development
```bash
# Format, lint, and test (complete workflow)
make check

# Format code
make fmt

# Run static analysis
make vet

# Run linter (requires golangci-lint)
make lint

# Development workflow: clean, check, build
make dev
```

### Cross-platform Building
```bash
# Build for multiple platforms
make build-all

# Manual cross-compilation examples
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build ./cmd/claude-config
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build ./cmd/claude-config
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build ./cmd/claude-config
```

## Architecture

### Manager Pattern
The application uses a manager-based architecture initialized in `main.go:init()`:

```go
// Key managers (all operate on ~/.claude directory)
configMgr   claude.ConfigManager  // Configuration management
proxyMgr    claude.ProxyManager   // HTTP/HTTPS proxy management  
checkMgr    *check.Manager        // Hooks system validation
deepSeekMgr claude.DeepSeekManager // DeepSeek API integration
```

All managers implement interfaces defined in `internal/claude/interfaces.go` and work with context-based operations.

    ├── commands/    # Custom Claude commands
    ├── hooks/       # Shell hook scripts for development workflows
    └── settings.json # Default Claude settings template
```

### Resource Management System
The resource system uses Go's `embed` package to bundle files at compile time. Resources are installed atomically to `~/.claude` with backup and conflict resolution:

- **Embedded Resources**: Files bundled into binary using `//go:embed`
- **Template Processing**: Dynamic content generation with customization
- **Configuration Merging**: Intelligent merging of settings.json with conflict resolution
- **Atomic Operations**: All installations are atomic with rollback capability

### Configuration Directory Structure
All operations target `~/.claude` as the base configuration directory:
```
~/.claude/
├── settings.json              # Main Claude settings (merged intelligently)
├── claude_config.toml         # Tool-specific configuration
├── agents/                    # Custom agent definitions
├── commands/                  # Custom commands
├── hooks/                     # Development hooks (linting, testing)
└── output-styles/             # Output formatting styles
```

## CLI Command Architecture

Built with Cobra framework, commands follow this pattern:
- Each command has dedicated implementation file in `cmd/claude-config/`
- Commands are registered in `initCommands()` function in `commands.go`
- All commands operate through manager interfaces for testability
- Interactive commands use consistent prompting patterns

### Available Commands
- `status` - Comprehensive configuration status across all managers
- `proxy` - Interactive proxy configuration with connectivity validation
- `check` - Hooks system management with language-specific validation  
- `deepseek` - DeepSeek API configuration and connection testing
- `install` - Resource installation with selective component installation
- `backup` - Configuration backup and restore with versioning

## Testing Architecture

### Test Strategy
- **Manager Interface Testing**: Focus on testing through interfaces defined in `internal/claude/`
- **Table-Driven Tests**: Used extensively for complex logic validation
- **Context-Based Testing**: All managers use context for cancellation and timeouts
- **File Operation Testing**: Comprehensive testing of atomic operations and merging logic

### Test Organization
```bash
# Test packages individually (faster during development)
go test ./internal/config      # Configuration management tests
go test ./internal/proxy       # Proxy functionality tests  
go test ./internal/file        # File operations and merging tests
go test ./internal/install     # Resource installation tests
go test ./internal/deepseek    # DeepSeek API integration tests
```

## Key Development Patterns

### Manager Initialization
All managers are initialized in `main.go:init()` with the Claude directory path:
```go
claudeDir := filepath.Join(homeDir, ".claude")
configMgr = config.NewManager(claudeDir)
```

### Context Usage
All manager operations use context for proper cancellation and timeout handling:
```go
func (m *Manager) Operation(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Implementation with context awareness
}
```

### Interface-Based Design
Core functionality is defined through interfaces in `internal/claude/interfaces.go`, enabling:
- Easy testing with mock implementations  
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent API across all managers

### Error Handling
Use simple error wrapping with context:
```go
return fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)
```
